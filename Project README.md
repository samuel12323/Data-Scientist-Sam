This project focuses on predicting stroke occurrence using machine learning (ML) models. Strokes, a leading cause of disability and mortality, can be influenced by factors such as age, hypertension, heart conditions, and lifestyle choices. Early prediction is crucial for prevention and management.

The research applies various ML models—decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and others—on a balanced dataset using the SMOTE technique to enhance accuracy. Unlike previous studies relying on a single model, this study compares six models to identify the most effective approach.

Key Objectives:

Analyze factors contributing to stroke risk.
Apply data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
Select appropriate performance metrics for stroke prediction.
Train ML models for optimal prediction accuracy.
Evaluate and compare multiple models on the dataset.
This research aims to develop a reliable, data-driven approach for stroke prediction, offering valuable insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers.
